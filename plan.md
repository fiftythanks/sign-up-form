# Version 2 Draft Plan
1. Make a precise static design in Figma (for your screen size).
  [x] Background image
  [ ] Form container design
      [ ] Make it resemble an old parchment/glowing scroll. Use CSS to add a subtle texture/gradient background that resembles aged paper.
      [ ] Add a faint glow around the form to stimulate the idea of a lantern being held by the guard.
      [ ] Slightly rounded corners
  [ ] Typeface
      [ ] For ancient, mystical vibe, use a serif font like Cinzel or Lora. 
  [ ] Colour palette
      [ ] Stick to earthy tones: warm golds, muted greens, and browns.
      [ ] Highlight the text with soft, glowing white or pale yellow to mimic lantern light.
  [ ] Header
      It should contain a message like, “The guard steps forward and says,”
  [ ] The guard's words
      Something like, “Welcome, stranger. I'm this land's guard. To enter our settlement, you must fill in this document”.
  [ ] Input fields
      [ ] Use inputs styled as old-fashioned fields, such as bordered by faint gold lines or wood-textured outlines.
      [ ] Add soft drop shadows to inputs to give a 3D effect.
  [ ] Submit button
      Make it look like rune or enchanted symbol.
2. Create a slightly animated page from that design.
  [ ] Make the form fade or glide in from the shadows.
  [ ] Submit button
      Use hover effects for brightness or glowing.
3. Add effects for the ambience (sound, glowing etc.)
  [ ] Add subtle glowing or flickering effects to elements, like the button or input borders, to stimulate torchlight.
  [ ] Make the cursor look like in some Heroes of Might and Magic game.
  [ ] Add ambient sound effects or background music to enhance the atmosphere, like faint forest noises or crackling fire.
  [ ] Incorporate icons, such as a lantern or a sword, near the header for extra detail.
